# RockBuddy

## Synopsis
This program is a rock collection companion app. It provides a way for rock collectors to digitize their collection. Users can add samples, edit samples, remove samples, and view their collection. Samples include the rock name, rock id, composition, structures, and more. Users can add multiple pictures per Sample if they wish. I had 15 hours to build the project. 

## Motivation
Apart from demonstrating what I learned in Industry Projects at Southwest Tech, I wanted a way to categorize and easily view rock samples that I have collected. I also have friends who enjoy rock tumbling and would like ways to document the process of the samples they tumble.

## How to Run
To run the program, users will need to have the BackEnd.java, FrontEnd.java, samples.txt, and css files, along with the Images folder. JavaFx is also needed to run the project. Once the user is all set up, they will need to run the BackEnd before running the FrontEnd. From there the user can interact with the gui to add samples. The samples.txt file included in the repo has a few of my own Samples added to the collection. The program can remove these if they wish.

## Tests
Due to the fact that only one method returns a value that is not a JavaFx element, no JUnit tests were written. 

## Contributors
I wrote all the code myself. 
There are a few updates I would like to make, such as making the code more readable and better styling. I hope to eventually roll these out.
